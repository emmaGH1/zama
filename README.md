# 🛡️ Zama Developer Program Contribution

Welcome to my submission for the [Zama Developer Program](https://www.zama.ai/developer-hub), where I explored confidential smart contracts using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and contributed to building privacy-preserving Web3 applications.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This repository contains my work with Zama’s confidential smart contract templates using the **FHEVM** — a virtual machine that enables encrypted computations on-chain.

### Key Objectives:
- Explore the power of **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** on EVM-compatible blockchains.
- Build and test confidential smart contracts using `fhevm` and `zama-lv3.sh` tooling.
- Contribute to the growing ecosystem of privacy-first Web3 apps.

---

## 🚀 What I Did

- 🧪 Cloned and initialized the Zama template repository
- 🔐 Worked with encrypted values (`euint64`) for balances and transfers
- 🛠️ Modified and ran the `zama-lv3.sh` script for local setup
- 📦 Deployed/tested on the compatible testnet with Zama’s FHE toolset

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- `Solidity ^0.8.26`
- `FHEVM` (Zama’s Confidential EVM Layer)
- Zama Developer Tools (`fhevm`, `zama-lv3.sh`)
- Git, VS Code, CLI

---

## 💡 Why Zama?

Zama makes it possible to build decentralized applications where **user data remains confidential**, even during computation. This is a major step toward **privacy-by-default** in crypto and Web3.
